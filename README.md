# 📊 Advanced Portfolio Optimization Dashboard

## 📝 Project Overview
This Power BI project presents an advanced, interactive dashboard designed for portfolio performance evaluation and optimization. Developed as a final project for the *Financial Data Analytics* course, it enables users to compare equal-weight and optimized-weight portfolios using real financial data and statistical metrics.
